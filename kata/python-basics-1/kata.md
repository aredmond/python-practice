# Python Basic Kata

## 1. Variables

### Define Vars

1. Define a integer
2. Define a second integer
3. Print both integers
4. Type cast a integer variable from 1 or 2 into a float and print it.

## 2. Basic Built in functions

### Use the following built in functions

1. type()
2. print()
3. range()
4. int()
5. str()
6. float()
7. len()

## 3. List

### List Challenges

1. Define a list with 1 string, 1 int and 1 float
2. Print the 3rd element of your list
3. Define a emply list
4. Reverse the order of the list from 1., do it 2 different ways
5. Create a list of numbers from 0-9
```
numlist = list(range(10))
```
6. 0utput only the first 3 elements of numlist
7. output only the last 3 elements of numlist
8. output every other element of numlist
9. output numlist backwards
10.  Loop through numlist and print every element

## 3. Dict

### Dict Challenges

1. Define a dict with 2 key pairs make sure one of the keys is 'fuel'
2. Print the value for key 'fuel' of the dict from 1.
3. Use help to find a built in function for dicts creates a set-like object with all the keys. hint help(dict1)
4. Define another dict with 2 or more key pairs
5. Add a key pair to the dictionary from step 4.
6. Define a empty Dict
7. Combine dicts from 1 and 2 into one new dict
8. Loop through all element of the dict from 2. and print the keys and values

## 4. Tuples

### Tuple Challenges

1. Create a tuple with 3 elements
2. Create a list with the same elements as 1.
3. Append the same value to the list and the tuple showing how the append fails with the tuple
